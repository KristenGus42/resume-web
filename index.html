        <h2> HCP </h2>
        <a href="https://hcp-uw.vercel.app/"> <p> Visit the website here! </p> </a>
        <p>
          The Husky Coding Project (HCP) is a student organization that aims to give students internship like experiences
          through team projects. For my team's project I am the Project Manager, and additionally for the club I am a club lead
          for the education board.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responsibilities as a Project Manager:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Attend 2-3 meetings a week (about 2-3 hours per week) </li>
          <li> Delegate tasks to members </li>
          <li> Created and executed a detailed specification for our project with team members </li>
          <li> Communicate with teammates to design and implement code </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Responsibilities as a Club Lead:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Collaborate with fellow club leads about workshops and club resources </li>
          <li> Develop and implement supplementary materials for club teams </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Billboard </h2>
        <p>
          The project my team did for the 2022-2023 school year was titled Billboard. This project was my first formal introduction
          to professional collaboration and leadership. My team and I used this as an opportunity to learn web development skills
          and API integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Billboard is a web based trivia app that used the user's spotify data to create questions based on their specific music taste.
          Some skills we learned through this implementation include using APIs, using O-Auth as well as integrating code with hosting services,
          in particular we attempted to use firebase. Unfortunatley because of Spotify's developer's restrictions we are not allowed to officially
          publish our website. Below is some images and videos showcasing the website, alongside the github.
        </p>
        <h2> Eduhacks 2024</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of the education team I got to work with a group of 2 other students to develop a ChatGPT integration
          workshop for students participating in the 2024 hackathon Eduhacks. I created the github and wrote a good amount of
          code for this workshop. I carefully created a workshop activity yor students to follow along with my presentaion. The
          aim of this workshop was to teach students how to use the OpenAI API and create a full stack web app using node and
          express.
